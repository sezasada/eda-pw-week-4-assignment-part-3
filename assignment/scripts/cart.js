// Make sure to test all functions here in the JS file!
// We want to see how you are testing your code!!!
const basket = [];
//- Create a global variable named `basket` and set it to an empty array.

//- Create a function called `addItem`. It should:
//  - take an input parameter for a string `item`
//  - add the new item to the global array `basket`. 
//  - return `true` indicating the item was added
function addItem(item) {
    console.log('added new item', item);
    basket.push(item);
    return true;
}
addItem('jesus');
addItem(' mary');
console.log(`Basket is ${basket}`);
console.log('Adding apples (expect true)', addItem(' apples'));
console.log(`Basket is now ${basket}`);
//- Create a function called `listItems`. It should:
//  - loop over the items in the `basket` array
//  - console.log each indiviconst x = 0;
const x = 0;
function listItems(basket) {
    if(x <= basket.length) {
        return basket[x];
    }
}
console.log(listItems(basket));

//- Create a function called `empty`. It should:
//  - reset the `basket` to an empty array

//> __IMPORTANT__
//> Make sure that you are writing code *in the file* to test every function that you write!

//For example, to test `addItem`:
//```
//console.log(`Basket is ${basket}`);
//console.log('Adding apples (expect true)', addItem('apples'));
//console.log(`Basket is now ${basket}`);
//```

//### Stretch Goals 
//Remember that Stretch Goals are not required, but will help you to further develop concepts from the skills we have covered.

//__Using functions in other functions!__

//1. Add a global `const` named `maxItems` and set it to 5.

//2. Create a function called isFull(). It should:
//  - return `false` if the basket contains *less* than max number of items
//  - return `true` otherwise (equal or more than maxItems)

//3. Update the required `addItem` function to:
//  - Use the `isFull` function to prevent more than `maxItems` from being added to the basket. 
//  - If an item was added to the array, return `true`
//  - If there was no room and the item could not be added return `false`

//__Using Array built-in functions!__

//4. Create a function called `removeItem`. It should:
//  - Take an input parameter for a string `item`
// - Use [Array.indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) to find the index of the first matching item in the basket.
//  - Use [Array.splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) to remove the first matching item from the basket.
//  - Return the item removed or `null` if the item was not found
